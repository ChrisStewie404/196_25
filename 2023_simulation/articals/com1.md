# data : TRACE(Tropical  Responses  to  Altered  Climate  Experiment)  
## irregular weather cycle: 
- drought(2015)  
- 2 years of experimental warming  
- two major hurricanes(Irma  and  María,  September  2017) 
# selected species: 
- drought-tolerant
- fast-growing  
- 
# specie character:
- cover (cover area)    
- biomass(dominance)  
# plant community (vegetation) character: 
- cover 
- richness 
- diversity  
- composition  
- (stability)  
# weather influence on plant community (vegetation) 
weather influence <--> **soil condition**  
## factors(weather)  
- temperature  
- precipitation  
- drought time 

- wetness (precipitation temperature)
- nutrients decompositon speed (precipitation temperature)
- oxydren  (temperature )
- soil erosion(drought)

# possible conclusions:  
-  Q: impact of a greater frequency and wider variation of the occurrence of 
droughts in future weather cycles  
A: plant  communities  might  shift  over  time  toward  **fast-growing**  or  **drought-tolerant** species

# data: 
TRACE(Tropical  Responses  to  Altered  Climate  Experiment)  
 \>= 4 species, must include: 
- fast-growing  
- drought-tolerant  
- slow-growing  
- drought-sensitive 

for each specie, must include: 
- biomass  
- cover  
for each plant community, must include: 
- richness 

# simulation condition setting  
- sample:  
**forest** (carbon-sink & long-lasting effect )(https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk1643)
- 1 cycle == 1 year  
- \>=3 cycles

# evaluation 
## response to drought  
Two key strategies that determine a tree’s response to drought are  
(1) **stomatal control** and (2) **cavitation resistance**, leading to 2 distinct types of trees: 
(1) water spender (weak in long-term drought)  
(2) water saver (quick to response, may suffer carbon starvation during prolonged drought)
## total plant cover
- The total plant cover is determined by the formula $TPC  = n/N \times 100$ ,with n: number of points where the vegetation is present and N: numbers of total points in eachtransect .
## Shannon information index(diversity) $I_s$  
- $$I_s = -\sum lg(N_i/N) \cdot (N_i/N) \\$$
   where N_i = {numbers  of the ith specie}  

## stability  
temporal mean productivity ( $\mu$ ) divided by the temporal SD in community productivity ( $\sigma$ )  
## diversity  
- different species perform relatively better in mixtures than in **monocultures**, for example, through **complementary resource use or facilitation** and this higher performance can increase community stability. Second, decreased temporal variation in productivity through buffering of the effects of environmental stress may increase community stability.
